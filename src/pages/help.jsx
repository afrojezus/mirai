              Is it legal to watch anime or read manga on here?
            </Typography>
            <Typography type="body1">
              TL;DR: Yes.
              <br />
              As stated by several other big anime sites, it is legal to watch
              anime on here due to the fact it's not hosted by the site.<br />
              The provider is technically the one at fault, and as a secondary
              measure we've not allowed users to download any of the episodes
              provided here. <br />We want to keep it fair to a level in the
              same manner as 9anime and Masteranime does, but by not necessarily
              roaming the ocean of piracy.
              <br />
              Nyaa mode (which is under testing) is a doubtful legal feature; it
              streams the episodes from a torrent source, and due to the
              questionable nature of torrenting these days, we've kept it
              disabled for now.
              <br />
              <br />
              As an addition, we provide links where you can support the
              creators by referring to a Blu-ray set of the same anime, or a
              copy of their manga at Amazon.
              <br />
              <br />
              Any complaints regarding copyright will be observed, and we will
              ensure the copyrighted content will no longer be avaliable on
              Mirai.

              Mirai uses optimized measures to give maximum performance out of
              the styling profile it has.<br />
              On Blink-based browsers such as Google Chrome and Opera; the
              performance should be at the best due to their consistent hardware
              acceleration measures.<br />
              On other browsers such as Firefox; the performance will be worse,
              not due by the styling effects, but by design. Consider enabling
              WebRenderer if the problem is too apparent.<br />
              <br />
              Microsoft Edge has a special case scenario where as the
              performance exceeds that of Blink-based browsers, the styling is
              broken on several areas. We're working on solving this.

              You have to wait. As of now, we currently do not host the episodes
              and rely on Anime Twist to providing them. However, with
              sufficient funds we could eventually host anime, with the endgoal
              of having licenses to host them.<br />
              In the meanwhile we recommend similar services as{" "}
              <a href="https://masterani.me/">Masteranime</a> for keeping up
              with anime, and <a href="https://mangarock.com/">MangaRock</a> for
              manga.
              <br />
              Feel free to use the big ones as well. (Crunchyroll, Netflix,
              Amazon Prime, etc.)

            <Typography type="body1">
              AniList syncing works in the manner of preferring Mirai data
              first, then AniList.<br />
              You'll see data marked as AL if it's from AniList; this is to
              seperate conflicting data from both ends.
              <br />
              Everything you do in Mirai that will trigger an event in AniList
              will be synced with your AniList account. That implies watching
              anime, reading manga, updating favorites and what you add to your
              History.
